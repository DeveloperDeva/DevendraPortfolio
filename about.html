        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a skilled software developer with expertise in Java and marketing. During my time at Atypical Advantage, I gained valuable experience in marketing. I have also worked with Python technologies such as AI and ML, and front-end technologies including HTML and CSS, completing numerous projects over a period of 6 months. I have a Star on Codechef and am proficient in several programming languages, including C++, C, and Python, as well as electronics and data structures (DSA).

          Additionally, I have experience in delivering engaging presentations and possess relevant certifications. As an ambitious professional, I am constantly seeking challenging opportunities to learn new technologies and apply my skills to achieve optimal results.
          <br><br>
          In my free time, I enjoy watching movies. Let's connect and explore how we can work together.
